## Meg Rosenfeld 

Meg Rosenfeld has a background in early childhood education and administration. A parent of four children currently in the DVSD district, she is currently homeschooling her two youngest children, not yet eligible for the vaccine, due to the unsafe conditions at the schools – conditions created by the current DVSD Board. She believes that “compassion, ethics, and critical thinking” are fundamental to policy development. Meg’s commitment in justice and advocacy led her to become a certified Pennsylvania Victims Advocate and paralegal, where she relentlessly advocates for our most vulnerable communities.
